    "Zap Inc does not provide a KPI metric, so we are just going to minimise the forecast error. Furthermore, given the lack of indications, we are going to weight the errors uniformly. This means that we can rely on `scikit-learn` and other Python packages that provide an interface to find the optimal parameters with a default (and non-customisable) loss function. In other settings, though, we might want to value underestimates more than overestimates, or viceversa. Another common practice is to give a higher weight to the forecast error of the first $n$ months/weeks/days, or use a decay function so that the weight error of the forecast at $t + 365$ would have a smaller impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of an error metric is not trivial, though. There are three main \"mainstream\" candidates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean absolute error (MAE). Averages out the error of each prediction, computed as ($|y_t - \\hat{y_t}|$). It's easy to interpret, as it preserves the scale and has a unit of measurement.\n",
    "- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). It's the MAE, but the error term is divided by $y_t$ to obtain a percentage. Makes it simpler to perform comparisons, however can become tricky to work with if the $y$ is zero.\n",
    "- (Root) mean squared error (R)MSE. Same as the MAE, only that the error is computed as $({y_t - \\hat{y_t}})^2$. This means that bigger errors weight more. Since the error is squared, the MSE can be much greater than the units of measurement. To shrink it, we can take its squared root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using the same units - after all, we are comparing different forecasts for the same time series, the MAE seems an adequate and interpretable choice. We can also compute the MAPE, since our datapoints are always greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technical note. The chosen models (GBRT, linear regression) minimise the mean squared error. Regardless, the coefficients that minimise the MSE are the same that minimise the MAE."

    "But what is a harmonic regression? Simply put, it's a model with features that are a function of sine and cosine. Sine and cosine are smooth (and non-monotonic) functions that allow us to capture non-linear effects. The idea behind this modeling strategy is that sine and cosine waves add up to build the \"wave\" pattern of the target series. For another explanation, please see [the reference book](https://otexts.com/fpp3/useful-predictors.html#fourier-series) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}(t) = \\mu + \\delta t + \\sum_{i=1}^K\\left[\\alpha_i\\sin(2\\pi\\frac{i}{periodicity}t) + \\beta_i\\cos(2\\pi\\frac{i}{periodicity}t)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu$ is the intercept, $t$ is the time step, and inside the summation we find $K$ the periodic components. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos recommend $K$ to be no greater than the periodicity. Periodicity, int this case, is the seasonal period of the series. We can have as many periodic \"groups\" of harmonic components as we wish. In our case, we could try 7 and 365, i.e. weekly and annual periodicity."

    "\n",
    "One more thing. Since the model will be a linear regression, we should treat the `holiday` column differently. We cannot use a ordinal encoder, because encoding holidays as integers implies cardinality as well - in other words, it binds the values to a numerical sequence of evenly spaced points, which is an assumption we cannot make (technically speaking, we could move this critique to the GBRT model as well, since we passed the `year`, `month` and `weekday` features as integer variables - though this is arguably less problematic, given the non-parametric non-linear nature of the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use a different strategy, named one-hot encoding, that turning every category in the `holiday` column into its own column. Every observation in the new column is assigned a zero except when the holiday falls on the correct date. This approach works, except when the resulting dataset is \"sparse\", i.e. contains a lot of zeros. This will be our case: since each holiday occurs once a year, and our training splits are 7 years long, we would only have 7 nonzero rows out of more than 2500.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is best to turn the column into an indicator variable, i.e. a variable that takes value `1` on holidays and `0` otherwise. Keep in mind that this might cause problems when a holiday falls on a weekend."

    "* We might want to quantify the uncertainty of our predictions. GBRT can also be fit minimising quantile losses; we can minimise the 10th and 90th quantile retrieve confidence intervals for our model (e.g. [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-ensemble-plot-gradient-boosting-quantile-py)). This can be simpler than [using MAPIE](https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_regression/4-tutorials/plot_ts-tutorial.html).\n",

    "* Adding lagged terms to the GBRT could improve performance. Creating lagged terms introduces missing values, which GBRT can handle natively. On the other hand, adding lagged terms to the harmonic model won't be as straightforward, though it could simply be enough to drop missing values since we would be losing a few rows over seven years worth of observations. If the model were to be retrained every week or month, this should not pose a problem. On the other hand, lagged terms force us to rethink how we obtain predictions (see [here](https://skforecast.org/0.9.1/introduction-forecasting/introduction-forecasting#multi-step-forecasting) for an introduction on single-step vs multi-step forecasting)."
